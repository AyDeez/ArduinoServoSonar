# OPERATING SYSTEMS PROJECT

## ARDUINO SERVOMOTOR SONAR

This project is part of an exam that is scheduled to be done during the year 2025.

The files in this repo are listed below:

* AVR folder - folder containing the basics of avr programming
* main.c - main file of the project containing the core implementation
* Makefile - used for compiling and uploading file to the arduino
* .gitignore - used by git


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Arduino controls a sonar system, guiding its orientation through a servomotor and sending the obtained data on the serial port.

Several parameters can be adjusted through the PC, such as:

* sampling frequency
* minimum and maximum angle
* sampling angle
* option to lock the orientation

To display the output, one may use a library of choice.
